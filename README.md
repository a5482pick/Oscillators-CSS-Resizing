An alternate version of the modelling of the 2-masses, 3-springs in repository 'coupled-oscillators-analytic' is created.  This version has CSS that both resizes and reshapes the 'webpage' layout to suit the window's dimensions.  (By contrast, the CSS in 'coupled-oscillators-analytic' results in a directly proportional size-reduction of the page's items when the window is reduced in size.  No reshaping occurs.)  The canvas animation continues to play even when the window has been resized.  Oscillator2.html is a slight variation on Oscillator.html:  the former resizes using CSS, the latter resizes using javascript.  Oscillator2.html uses main2.js in place of main.js.  Otherwise, both html files execute identically and either may be loaded into your browser.

EDIT July 2017:  Refactored code to remove global variables etc. &nbsp; Each _.js_ file is now essentially self-contained, and may be edited without breaking the other scripts.  

Additionally, noticed  animation was apparently no longer smooth in Chrome. &nbsp; Reducing 'ratioHeight' to 0.075 and 'ratioWidth' to 0.79 appears to have rectified this problem. &nbsp; (This problem could also be rectified by reducing the browser's window size.)
