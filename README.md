An alternate version of the modelling of the 2-masses, 3-springs is created.  This version has CSS that reshapes the 'webpage' layout according to the 
window's dimensions.  (By contrast, the CSS in repo. 'coupled-oscillators-analytic' results in a straightforward minimisation that is proportional to the screen size.)
  In both versions, the canvas continues to play even when the window has been resized.
